- 👋 Hi, I’m @RedMoneyMurder
- 👀 I’m interested in movies and novels which are based on real life events. More less gotta be as true and correct events, or I'm not jacking it...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to make my own beats, record my own tracks, & gradually progressing to eventually produce my own rap videos and expand as an independent artist/ producer.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my upcoming hip hop/ rap album if anyone is interested? "Serious inquiries only, please and thank you."
- 📫 How to reach me (email me: "252redmoneymurder@gmail.com")
